JavaScript: it is used to add functionality into webpage or webapp.
           -it is used to make website or webapp dynamic.
           -it is interpreted language.
           -it is loosely type language.

*Why js is called as loosely typed language?
when we create a variable in JavaScript at that time cannot determine what type of data it contains until and unless we store value or data in it.

*there are two ways to use js:
1. internal js.: in html file we use script tag and in that  we write js code.
2. external js.: in this we create a separate js file and import in html file in head section.

-JavaScript is a object base language.
-in JavaScript window is a global object.

*How to get output in JavaScript?
-there are four ways to get output in JavaScript:
1. document.write(): it is print output on webpage at the bottom of webpage.
2. window.alert(): it is display output at popup window
3. console.log(): it will display the output in browser console.
4. DOM(Document Objet Model): 

*variable
-it is used to store data in it.
-in js we can create variable by using var, let and const keyword.
 
 var: it is used to create functional scope variable.
 let: it is used to create block scope variable.
 const: it is used to constant variable, we have initialize it when create it. it's value never going to be change.

 *Data Types in JavaScript:
 1. number: 120, 0.5, 35654
 2. string: " " or ' '
 3. boolean: true or false
 4. undefined: no value
 5. null: variable with empty data.

 6. array: it stores multiple value of same data type.
           -in array data stored on index basis.
           -array index always starts from zero index.
           -we can array data outside by writing arrayName[indexNumber]
           -array denoted by []

 7. object: it stores multiple value with different data type.
            -in object data stores in key and value pairs.
            -we can access object data outside by writing object, keyName.
            -object denoted by {}

*Operators 
1. Arithmetic: +,-,*,/;
/: it returns quotient.
%: it returns remainder.
**: it returns power of any number.

2. Relational Operators
<,>,<=,>=,!=

*in JavaScript + Operator is used for two purposes.
1. to perform addition
2. to perform concatenation.

*comparison Operator
== : it check only value and if both are same then it return true value.
=== : it check both value as well as its data type if both are same then it return true value.

*FUnctions and Advanced function is JavaScript
-function is a block of code which is used to perform specific task.
and function will get execute when we called it.
-it is used to re-use code.

array:
-it stores multiple value of same data type.
-


*Object:- it stores multiple values with same data type;
        - in object data store in 

*Array of object
*How to insert date in website using js.
-if we want to get date in js for that we have crate object of date class.

*string and its methods.
*stringOf:- it is collection of characters.
        - it is also datatype in js.
        -in string every character has number and it starts from zero.

*String methods to find out its index:
1.index(): it start search of index from left to right.
            -it takes two parameteres. i.seaechig string ii.start-indexNumber.
            -if searching is not not found then it return -1 as result.

2.lastindexOf(): it returns index or first occurences of strting.

3.search(): it returns index or first occurences of string.
            -it starts seraching of index from  left to right.
            -it takes two parameteres 1.searching string 
            -if searching is not found then it returns -1 as a result.
            -it is faster than indexOf()

*String methods to find partial part of string from index.

*4. slice(start-index,end-index): it returns partial part of string from given index number.
           -it takes two parameteres 1.start-index, 2.end-index.
           -if pass +ve value then it will search from left to right.
           -if pass -ve value then it will serch from right to left.

*5. subString(start-index,end-index): it returns partial part of string from given index number.

6* subStr(start-index, end-index): it return partial part string from given index number.
-it takes two parameter 1.start-index, 2.number character.
-if pass +ve 

*ES5(2009) and ES(6)
1.trim(): it is used to remove unwanted white spaces from both sides of the string.

what is callback method:
-passing one method as a parameter to another function is called callback function.
